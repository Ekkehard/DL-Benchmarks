# DL-Benchmarks
Deep Learning benchmarks for systems with and without GPU with code snippets from Chollet's book.

The code contained here is mostly a straight copy of examples from Francois Chollet's book "Deep Learning with Python."  All code is in the src directory.  The logs directory contains logs obtained by running the code examples on different systems, with and without GPU support.  The doc directory contains an Engineering Report detailing the results.
